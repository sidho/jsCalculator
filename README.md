# Calculator

This is a simple calculator built using Polymer, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
Try the live demo [here](https://sidho.github.io/jsCalculator/).

### About the app

The calculator's logic was designed to emulate a traditional calculator,
rather than one that takes all the inputs and operations in at once, i.e.,
"1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5" as an input.

The calculator can be used as a Polymer element, simply by placing the
calculator folder into a project's the elements folder. This was tested to work by
creating a project using Polymer's (zip)[https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/getting-the-code.html#using-zip] install file and creating a new HTML file
that loaded the required dependencies. The tag used for this calculator is
<my-calculator></my-calculator>.

The calculator has two themes, "light" or "dark", and the themes can be selected
using the theme="" attribute in the tag. The calculator automatically defaults
to "light". You can see the themes in action in the aforementioned demo, by
pressing the "Toggle Theme" button.
